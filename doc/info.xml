		<element name="Blood Chest" img="true" recipe="true">
            Ever had to repair that precious enchanted diamond sword, only to find out 
            that your limited supply of diamonds has run out? Then you may find the [u]blood 
            chest[/u] a very handy addition ! 
            Just put in whatever tool you want and the blood chest will gradually repair 
            it at only the expense of some [u]blood[/u]. To fill the blood chest, just insert
            any item containing blood into the very left slot and watch how the internal
            blood buffer fills up. But beware ... this chest might add some nasty effects
            to your repaired item (NOTE: this feature can be disabled in the configuration file).

		<element name="Blood Infuser" img="true" recipe="true">
		    As its name suggests, the [u]blood infuser[/u] can infuse or fill items with [u]blood[/u].
            Simply put an item containing blood in the left slot to fill up the internal blood buffer and put an item
            in the slot directly to the right of the liquid meter to start infusing or filling items with blood.
            Some items that can be filled with blood are vanilla buckets, [u]blood containers[/u] and the [u]blood extractor[/u].
            The blood infuser is also the only way to gain [u]dark power gems[/u] and [u]undead saplings[/u].

        <element name="Environmental Accumulator" img="true">
            The [u]environmental accumulator[/u] allows you to fill [u]weather containers[/u] with the weather that is currently
            active. You do this by throwing an [u]empty weather container[/u] into the brown beam emitted by the accumulator.
            This will suck up the weather, bottle it into the weather container and change the weather to its complete
            opposite (sunshine becomes rain, rain/lightning becomes sunshine).
            Once used, the beam of the environmental accumulator will become black, which means that it is currently
            in a cooldown state. It will remain in this state for about half a minecraft day, and you can see that it
            has returned to its originally state because the beam will change back to a brown color.
            (NOTE: the cooldown time can be changed in the configuration file)
            Note that this block can not be crafted or picked up and that these blocks only spawn at the centre of [u]dark temples[/u].

		<element name="Blood" img="true">
			Yeah... its liquid blood...
		</element>
		<element name="Poison" img="true">
			EvilCraft also adds liquid [u]poison[/u], but don't worry you won't find it spawning
			in the world, well ... at least not yet.
			To get some poison, just put a water bucket and any poisoned item in a crafting
			table and you will obtain a bucket of poison.
			Examples of poisoned items are poisoned potatoes and [u]poison sacs[/u].
		</element>
	</element>
	<element name="World Generation">
		<element name="Dark Ore" img="true">
			For now, EvilCraft adds only one new ore to the world generation, called [u]dark ore[/u].
			This ore spawns from Y-levels 6 to 66 (see what we did there) and drops [u]dark
			gems[/u] upon breaking. You will at least need an iron tier pickaxe to mine it
			and fortune does have an effect on the drop rate.

		<element name="Dark Temple" img="true">
			When exploring, you might come across some weird-looking structures called [u]dark temples[/u].
            You can find them at higher places (above Y-level 90) and they should be easy 
            to spot because of the brown beacon beam that is emitted by the environmental accumulator 
            at the centre of the structure.
            Also note that dark temples are the only places where you can find [u]environmental accumulators[/u].
